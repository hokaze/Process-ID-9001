### Process ID 9001 ###

## A prototype Twine game about AI ##

# Summary #
Written as a first foray into Twine, Interactive Fiction, CSS and the Harlowe story format.
Undertake research projects, infect networked computers, abuse your botnet to mine cryptocurrency and generally attempt to build up resources while avoiding detection by humanity.
Very much a WIP. Heavily inspired by "Endgame: Singularity".
